### Abstract

How does social media usage influence political participation? This article introduces a three–stage framework—Network Expansion, Platform Convergence, and Political Segregation—that clarifies when and how social media environments generate systematic patterns of partisan sorting. We argue that political segregation restores a positive relationship between social media usage and political efficacy. We test this three-stage framework using two large-scale surveys in the United States (ANES 2024, n = 4,931) and Taiwan (PollcracyLab 2025, n = 1,300). The results show that political segregation is evident on newer platforms in both Taiwan (TikTok, Xiaohongshu, and Threads) and the United States (Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, and TikTok), but not on established platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (X). Moreover, partisans who use the platforms dominated by their preferred political camp report higher levels of political efficacy. These findings carry implications for survey methodology, polarization, mobilization, and fact-checking.
