### Abstract

Under what conditions do authoritarian leaders use redistribution alongside repression? Conventional wisdom suggests that autocrats use redistribution as a substitute for repression to reduce social unrest without provoking public backlash. I argue instead that the choice between repression and redistribution depends on autocrats’ cost–benefit calculations and the availability of fiscal resources. In resource-dependent autocracies, higher levels of repression are positively associated with increased redistribution. Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) complement repression by redistributing without relying on taxation, thereby preserving regime longevity.

Using Conditional Cash Transfers as a proxy for redistribution and analyzing data from 101 countries between 1990 and 2015, this paper employs a Random Effects Between–Within (REBW) model to examine the relationship between repression and redistribution. The results show that repression and redistribution are positively correlated when conditional on natural resource rents. Furthermore, the interaction between repression and natural resource rents suggests that regimes with consistently higher levels of repression and abundant natural resources tend to allocate more CCTs. These findings deepen our understanding of how authoritarian regimes strategically combine repression and redistribution to maintain political stability, particularly in resource-rich contexts. By extending the logic of rentier state theory to welfare provision, this study contributes to broader debates on authoritarian governance, political economy, and the institutional tools dictators use to sustain power.
