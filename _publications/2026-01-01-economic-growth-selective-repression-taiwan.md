### Abstract

What repressive strategies do dictators employ to maintain regime stability as anti-government movements intensify under conditions of economic growth? This article examines how the function of authoritarian repression changes as regimes confront rising opposition during periods of economic development, focusing on Taiwan’s White Terror period under Kuomintang (KMT) rule. Using time-series data spanning 39 years (1949–1988), the study analyzes the relationship between economic development, social mobilization, and shifts in repression strategies. Drawing on historical archival materials and statistical analysis, I argue that economic growth alters the logic of repression. As economies expand, dictators are more likely to substitute selective repression for indiscriminate violence such as mass killings, since the latter risks provoking broader social unrest and undermining regime stability. Employing an Additive Dynamic Linear Model (ADLM), the analysis shows that economic development, when combined with rising social movements, systematically pushes authoritarian leaders toward less severe yet more targeted forms of coercion. While this strategic adaptation may temporarily stabilize authoritarian rule amid economic growth and social unrest, it may also erode the foundations of long-term authoritarian resilience. By integrating insights from the repression literature and modernization theory, this article highlights how authoritarian policy choices regarding repression critically shape the trajectories of both dictatorships and opposition movements.
