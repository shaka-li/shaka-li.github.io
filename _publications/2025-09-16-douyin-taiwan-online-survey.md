### Abstract

The rise of China-based social media platforms in Taiwan raises important questions about their influence on political attitudes and polarization. Among these emerging platforms, Douyin (抖音)—the Chinese version of the video-sharing application TikTok—has gained increasing popularity. Given its algorithm-driven recommendation system and prevalence of pro-CCP content, it is crucial to examine usage patterns of Douyin in relation to individuals’ political identity and sociodemographic characteristics in Taiwan. Drawing on online survey data collected in 2025, this study presents preliminary evidence on who uses Douyin in Taiwan. The findings indicate that respondents who support unification, identify as Chinese, and support the Kuomintang (KMT) are more likely to use Douyin than their pan-Green counterparts. In terms of demographic profiles, Douyin users are more likely to reside in the Taipei and Keelung areas, be male, and have at least a junior high school education, and they tend to spend more time on the platform than non-users. By providing a descriptive account of Douyin usage patterns, this study contributes to the literature on political psychology and voting behavior by engaging with ongoing debates on partisan echo chambers across social media platforms and their political consequences. Importantly, the findings highlight the need for future research on the political implications of algorithmically driven and authoritarian-led media environments in democratic societies.
